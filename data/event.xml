Trouble analysis procedures (TAPs)

TAP 100 — Troubleshoot ONT software alarms

Purpose: This TAP provides recommendations for isolating a problem indicated by an alarm report.

General: The alarms appear in response to one of the following TL1 commands:

Procedure:

Use this procedure to isolate problems indicated by alarm reports.

1 From the terminal window for the 7342 ISAM FTTU, enter the TL1 command to retrieve the current standing alarms.

2 From the response output, note the ONT related alarms:
• AID
• AID type
• Alarm severity
• Alarm condition
• Service effect

      Events are logged notifications from either the network or from 5526 AMS itself. Each
      event can be categorized as one of five autonomous notification types. These types are
      as follows (the corresponding TL1 command is listed after the event in parentheses,
      when applicable):
      • TL1 alarm (REPT ALM)
      • TL1 event report (REPT EVT)
      • TL1 environmental alarm (REPT ALM ENV)
      • TL1 switch report (REPT SW)
      • 5526 AMS alarm
